Love is inarticulate, liberating, hurting, healing…it’s an ordeal to be trapped in love. The eleven stories in the short story collection 'When Jaya met Jaggu and other stories' are stringed by the one thread called love. The characters imbue love at different levels.",

There was a farmer, a weary traveler, a trader, a child, a mother, a desiccated leaf, a pale flower, stretching their limbs; looking at the firmament for the first showers; whiffing the subtle petrichor; stifling an urge to gorge some damp mud…the arid lands longing to exhibit their shooting talent: all in green. There is so much more to this melodious and beauteous story of monsoon.",
